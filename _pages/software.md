- \texttt{seamlesssim}: This \texttt{R} package simulates data for complex early-phase oncology trials, to aid in evaluating trial operating characteristics. More details on the methods can be found in [Boonstra et al. (2021)](https://elizabethchase.github.io/files/boonstra_seamless.pdf), with details on how to use the package in the [manual](https://github.com/elizabethchase/seamlesssim/blob/master/seamlesssim_0.0.0.9000.pdf) and [vignette](https://github.com/elizabethchase/seamlesssim/blob/master/vignette.pdf).
