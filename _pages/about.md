Welcome to my website! I am in the final year of my PhD in biostatistics at the University of Michigan, advised by Drs. Philip S. Boonstra and Jeremy M. G. Taylor. 

My statistical research falls in a couple of domains: 

- Statistical shrinkage
- Bayesian nonparametrics
- Bayesian modeling
- Survival analysis 

And I work in several key collaborative areas:
- Prostate cancer care
- Women's health
- The Flint water crisis

Please feel free to read more about the above by clicking on the "Projects" tab above. 

Overall, I am passionate about using statistics to advance our understanding of real-world problems and am excited by interdisciplinary collaborative work.

Outside of work, I love to read, cook, and take long walks--preferably in the company of my friends or family. I am always happy to meet new people and do what I can to help others. My email is ecchase \[at\] umich \[dot\] edu. Please feel free to reach out!
