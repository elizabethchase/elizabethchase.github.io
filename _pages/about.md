Welcome to my website! I am in the final year of my PhD in biostatistics at the University of Michigan, advised by Drs. Philip S. Boonstra and Jeremy M. G. Taylor. 

My research falls in a couple of domains: 
- Using tools from Bayesian statistics and statistical shrinkage to fit abruptly changing associations (step functions, impulse functions, etc.)
- Quantifying competing risks tradeoffs to aid treatment decision-making 
- Flexible methods for analyzing competing risks endpoints
- Applied projects in prostate cancer care, women's health, and the Flint water crisis

Overall, I am passionate about using statistics to advance our understanding of real-world problems and am excited by interdisciplinary collaborative work.

Outside of work, I love to read, cook, and take long walks--preferably in the company of my friends or family. I am always happy to meet new people and do what I can to help others. My email is ecchase \[at\] umich \[dot\] edu. Please feel free to reach out!
