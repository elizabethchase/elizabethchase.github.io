Welcome to my website! I am in the final year of my PhD in biostatistics at the University of Michigan, advised by Drs. Philip Boonstra and Jeremy Taylor. 

My statistical research falls in a couple of domains: statistical shrinkage, Bayesian nonparametrics, Bayesian modeling, and survival analysis. 

I work in two primary collaborative areas: 1) prostate cancer care and 2) the long-term impacts of the Flint water crisis. 

Overall, I am passionate about using statistics to advance our understanding of real-world problems and am excited by interdisciplinary collaborative work.

Outside of work, I love to read, cook, and take long walks--preferably in the company of my friends or family. I am always happy to meet new people and do what I can to help others. My email is ecchase \[at\] umich \[dot\] edu. Please feel free to reach out!
